= Pipeline to Build execution environment

In this section, you will be working closely with the Ansible developer to troubleshoot and resolve an issue that is causing a failure in the deployment of the application. Using your expertise in the OpenShift Git Ops framework and the Automation Controller, you will investigate the root cause of the issue and implement a solution to ensure successful deployment in the future. The goal of this task is to quickly and efficiently identify and fix the problem, to minimize downtime and ensure the smooth operation of the application.

== Investigate the Issue

* Letâ€™s start with investigating the cause of failed job run.

. Login to Automation controller then navigate to Jobs and click on multitier-app-deployer failed job.

[NOTE] 
community.postgresql.postgresql_db module is used in the playbook shown in the error, which is missing in the default execution environment.

* *ee-automated-pipeline*: Repository containing configuration files for buildah to build EEs for Section 2 of the workshop.

== Resolution

As a Consultant you have investigated that community.postgresql collection is missing from the default EE used by the Job Template.

To resolve the issue you are going to build a custom EE which includes community.postgresql collection. For automating the task to build a custom EEs you are utilizing openshift-pipeline (tekton). 

The *tasks* as part of the pipeline are triggered using a Webhook created on Gitea. The *pipeline* will be triggered only when a new tag and release  is created in the code base of EE. The EEs images will be tagged based on the tag name and pushed to *Private Automation Hub*. 

. *Pipeline:* Defines a series of Tasks that accomplish a specific build or delivery goal. Can be triggered by an event or invoked from a PipelineRun.
The pipeline has already been configured for this workshop.

* *Tasks:* Defines a series of steps which launch specific build or delivery tools that ingest specific inputs and produce specific outputs.

* *Pipelinerun:* Instantiates a Pipeline for execution with specific inputs, outputs, and execution parameters.

* *Trigger:* specifies what happens when the EventListener detects an event.

* *EventListener:* listens for events on Kubernetes cluster. Specifies one or more Triggers.

. Find event-listener's route for creating webhook.
 .. Go to networking -> route -> p1-section1-event-listener then copy Location url and keep it saved 

. Find event-listener's secret for creating webhook.
.. Go to workloads -> secrets -> click on p1-section1-trigger-secret, then copy secretToken and save it we will it when creating webhook.


. Login to Gitea and configure webhook for the *ee-pipeline* repository.
